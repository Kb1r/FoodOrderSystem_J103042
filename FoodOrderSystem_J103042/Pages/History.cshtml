            <h4>Pyu City-States (200 BCE – 1050 CE)</h4>
            <p>
                The Pyu were among the earliest inhabitants of Myanmar, establishing city-states that
                thrived on agriculture and trade. Their adoption of Buddhism had a lasting impact on
                the region's culture and religious practices.

                The Bagan Empire marked the first unification of regions that now constitute modern
                Myanmar. Renowned for its architectural achievements, the plains of Bagan are dotted
                with thousands of temples and pagodas from this era.

                Following a series of Anglo-Burmese wars, Myanmar fell under British colonial rule in
                the 19th century. This period brought significant infrastructural developments but
                also led to economic exploitation and cultural changes.
